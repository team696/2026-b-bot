Hello Everyone! This is the for the 2026 FRC REBUILT code for Team 696 and their b-bot. The code has been written in the new 2026.1.1 version of the code.
Requirements:
 -RoboRIO MUST Be on the 2026 firmware version
 -All TalonFX motors MUST be updated to the latest 2026 firmware version
 -You MUST have the 2026.1.1 WPIlib installed on your device

Not having any of these can result in the code breaking.
